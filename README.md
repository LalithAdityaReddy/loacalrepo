Hi we used init then we created a directoery and addded some code files into it.
<br>
Then we created new repo in github.
<br>
After that we added new remote repo and name as origin inside the terminal, for the our local repo file(directroy)
<br>
then verifying the remote, checking branch, renaming branch to main and push origin to main.
